# miR4ASD: A Database of microRNAs associated in Autism Spectrum Disorder 

miR4ASD is an open-access, literature-based database that compiles human microRNAs (miRNAs) that were experimentally associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). It includes manually curated data from peer-reviewed case-control studies, covering gene expression and genetic variant analysis. All miRNA names from different studies are standardized to miRBase version 22.1 (https://www.mirbase.org/). 

This resource is designed for researchers working in neurogenetics, transcriptomics, and biomarker discovery. Its goal is to enable rapid identification of previously reported miRNAs and support the selection of strong candidates for future ASD-focused studies. 

Key features of mir4ASD: 

* Integrates gene expression and miRNA profiling data from ASD-control studies  
* Highlights tissue-specific expression patterns across brain and peripheral samples 
* Includes miRNAs with reported genetic variants â€” an underexplored area in ASD research 
* Supports biomarker discovery, functional studies, and genetic research in ASD
